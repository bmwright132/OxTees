    <blockquote><b><font size="6">  What began 40 years ago with a collection of Shirts has grown into an entire world, redefining American style. OX's Tees has always stood for providing quality products, creating worlds and inviting people to take part in our dream. We were the innovators of lifestyle advertisements that tell a story and the first to create stores that encourage customers to participate in that lifestyle.
        OXtees.com takes this participation to a new level as a rich and exciting interactive destination. When you're transported into the world of OX's Tees online, you can shop for great products for yourself and your home, learn about adventure, style and culture, find one-of-a-kind vintage pieces and exquisite gifts and much, much more. Back when all this started, I felt sure that there were no boundaries. I'm even more sure of that today.</font></b></blockquote>
